# Worldwide-Labour-Migration-Analysis

**Introduction**

<p align = "justify">
In todayâ€™s world, people migrate from one place to the other for growth and development. The most common 
purpose of migration is a money hike. According to statistics, not every person who migrates has profited. When 
people leave their homeland they feel stuck, lonely, and depressed, and face problems such as lack of 
opportunities, coping with a different common language, homesickness, lack of family support, and cultural 
differences in the migrated country. All these problems lead to underperformance in their career and ultimately 
not completing their goal of a money hike.

The dataset is extracted from LinkedIn's Economic Graph Initiative and World Bank Group, and is available at 
country, country-industry and country skill level based migrations. The migration in the dataset is recorded when 
a LinkedIn member changes location on their LinkedIn profile. All three datasets Country migration, industry 
migration and skill migration are extracted from the LinkedIn profiles who have migrated based on country, 
industry and skills. All three datasets will be used for extensive exploratory data analysis. The analysis and 
predictions from the project will help people who plan to migrate to a country and also companies in the target 
country to analyse people coming from the base country. The analysis can also be used to examine the economy 
of countries. Keeping this in mind, the project aims to analyse the netflow of people in the base country and target 
country for five consecutive years from 2015 to 2019 and predict the netflow for the year 2023.
